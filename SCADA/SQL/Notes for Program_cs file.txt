Create the TMCDB SQL database file:
-----------------------------------
You can do this with MS Access, or MS Visual Sstudio. I've used SQL Server 2014 Management Studio as well, it doesn't really matter which one.
Make sure it has at least the dbo.Buffer table with a BufferID<int> and Location<nvarchar(50)> columns.
Just need to put the SQL file in the DATA folder of the SCL server on the local PC or server PC.
On my PC this is:
C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL12.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\DATA



Create the "ConsoleApplicationTMCBuffer" project in MS Visual Studio:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Open MS Visual Studio.
Select File => New Project => Installed => Templates => Visual C# => Windows Desktop => Console App
Name it ConsoleApplicationTMCBuffer & put it in a suitable location.
Hit OK.



Setup the SQL connectionString in the project.
----------------------------------------------
Go to Solution Explorer.
Select ConsoleApplicationTMCBuffer => Properties. (Doubleclick on this)
Select Settings (on LHS menu).
Click on "This project does not contain a default settings file. Click here to create one".
Make the Name = connectionString
Make the Type = (Connection string) >> this is the last one in the list
Click in the Value section, then on the elipse. You should get the Connection Properties screen come up.

Select => Data Source = SQL Server
Select => Server Name (from list)
Select => Windows/SQL Authentication (depending on where file is, etc)
Select Database Name => list should show TMCDB

Test Connection should come back with success messsage. Hit OK.


Copy the main() method into the Program.cs file.
------------------------------------------------
Get the Program.cs file from GitHub (SCADA\SQL)
	or Google docs (\30_Assignment 3\31_Working Team Module\1. SCADA _ Remote System). 
Copy into the Program.cs file in the MS Visual Studio solution.

Build/run the solution.
