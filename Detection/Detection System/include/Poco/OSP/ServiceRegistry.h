class OSP_API ServiceRegistry
	/// The ServiceRegistry allows a bundle to provide services
	/// to other bundle, and to find services provided by
	/// other bundles.
	///
	/// A bundle can provide and register arbitrary services
	/// in the form of interface classes. Every service a bundle
	/// provides must be implemented in a class derived from
	/// Service. Service objects are reference counted.
	///
	/// A service can be implemented and registered as a singleton,
	/// meaning there exists exacty one instance of the service
	/// providing services to all bundles in the system.
	/// Alternatively, a service can be implemented and registered
	/// using a service factory. A service factory provides a unique
	/// instance of the service class to everyone requesting
	/// the Service object.
	///
	/// If a service is to be registered using a service factory,
	/// a corresponding subclass of ServiceFactory must be implemented
	/// for the Service class. An instance of the ServiceFactory
	/// must then be registered instead of the Service object itself.

		///     * name == "com.appinf.osp.sample.service" - a simple string comparison for equality.
		///     * majorVersion > 1 && minorVersion >= 5 - numeric comparisons and logical AND.

		///     * someProperty =~ /[0-9]+/ - regular expression matching.
